# Spam-Ham-Classification-ML
This task has been done as a part of my college project.
Task Description:Spam e-mail has become a very serious problem. Sending inappropriate messages to a large number of recipients has resulted in anger by users but large profits 
for spammers. In this part, I will walk through of building a simple text classifier which will identify Spam and Ham Emails which tags 5,172 text messages based on whether 
they are “spam” or “ham” (not spam).
This notebook is structured as follows:

1) Exploratory Data Analysis : In this section, we will explore the features and visualise the data and their relation.
2) Data Preprocessing: Removing Stop words, Lemmetize the text, Remove all the special characters, puctuations etc.
3) Implementing Machine Learning models : Implement a range of machine learning models and validate how they are performing.
4) Perform Hyperparameter Optimisation : SVM and Random Forest
5) Evaluate Best Model and apply various performence measures.
